                    I am a recent University of Texas at Dallas Graduate who is ready for the next chapter of my life.
                    I am cuurently an IT Intern at Leo A. Daly and while I am getting a lot of valuable IT experience I 
                    am excited to complete this journey of becoming a Front-End Developer. I love to create and design 
                    a fluid and intuitive user experience. Facing these challenging problems and excersising my creativity is 
                    my passion. 

                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical 
                    Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
                    Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a 
                    Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the 
                    undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
                    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, 
                    very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from 
                    a line in section 1.10.32.
